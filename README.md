![Design preview for the Manage landing page coding challenge](./assets/design/desktop-design.jpg)


A great challenge from "frontendmentor.io" to test responsive skills. There are lots of small details and slight content shifts for different screen sizes.

This project is created and initialized using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Link to the challenge on [frontmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5).

There is a `style-guide.md` file containing the required information, such as color palette and fonts.

The used reset for the CSS file: (https://gist.github.com/Asjas/4b0736108d56197fce0ec9068145b421)
