![Design preview for the Manage landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


A great challenge from "frontendmentor.io" to test responsive skills. There are lots of small details and slight content shifts for different screen sizes.

This project is created and initialized using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Link to the challenge on [frontmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5).

There is a `style-guide.md` file containing the required information, such as color palette and fonts.
